                         <p>I replied in the affirmative. Thereupon the Prophet (Peace be upon him) said: <blockquote>I recited four phrases three times after I had left you. If these are to be weighed against all you have recited since morning, these will be heavier. These are: Subhan-Allah Wa bihamdihi, ‘adada khalqihi, wa rida-a nafsihi, wa zinata ‘arshihi, wa midada kalimatihi (Allah is free from imperfection and I begin with His praise, as many times as the number of His creatures, in accordance with His Good Pleasure, equal to the ink that may be used in recording the words (for His Praise).

 <p>And in another narration, instead of mentioning that Allah will build a house in Jannah, it states, “and he will be raised one million levels.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi)</p>
